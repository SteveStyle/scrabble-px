# The nightly log check on the production host (#174).
#
# Reads the day's journal, validates it against the schema `docs/4.7` declares,
# writes exceptions to its own log, and refreshes a marker object **only on a
# clean run**.
#
# **It creates nothing and touches nothing.** Owner, 2026-08-21: *"the production
# check should just check the production logs, and write its own exception log."*
# The rare events a week of production would not show are covered elsewhere — the
# regression suite drives them in CI, which is where driving belongs.
#
# **The marker is why this alerts at all.** An alarm on the marker going stale
# fires for a dirty run *and* for this script crashing, the timer never being
# enabled, the host being down, or the credential expiring. An alarm waiting for
# a failure message only ever catches the failure somebody thought of.
#
# Usage: check-log-hygiene-nightly.sh      (run by tile-lite-elite-log-check.timer)
