# Take a consistent copy of the production database and put it somewhere the
# production machine cannot reach (#174).
#
# **Why offsite at all.** `deploy.sh` already snapshots before every deploy and
# keeps five — a good procedure that protects against a bad deploy, and useless
# against losing the box, because the snapshots are on the box. Two gaps: nothing
# leaves the VM, and nothing happens without a deploy, so a quiet fortnight means
# the newest copy is a fortnight old.
#
# **Why the VM cannot destroy what it writes.** The credential is a bucket-scoped
# pre-authenticated request with *permit object writes* and listing off. Tested
# from this machine on 2026-08-21: PUT 200, and GET, LIST, DELETE and HEAD all
# 404. So an attacker here — or a bug in this script — cannot remove a backup.
# The one thing a write PAR *can* do is overwrite an existing name, which is why
# the bucket has object versioning on and why the name carries a timestamp.
#
# **Why `VACUUM INTO` rather than tar.** SQLite runs in WAL mode, so copying the
# database file while the server holds it can catch the main file without the WAL
# entry that completes it. `VACUUM INTO` writes a single consistent file with the
# server still running — no downtime, and nothing to reassemble on restore.
